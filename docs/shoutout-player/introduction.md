# Introduction

The shoutout player is an advanced feature of the litoka project  

## OBS Browser source URL
At the top of the 'Shoutout Player' page in the Litoka website dashboard,  
A link is provided to copy and paste into an OBS browser source  
  
Recommended browser source settings:
- Width: 1280
- Height: 860
- FPS: 60
  
Note: the URL contains a unique identifier and therefore must be kept private.
A new URL can be generated by pressing the 'Get New Link' button if you think that the link has been revealed accidentally or if you're runing into general problems

## General Usage
The shoutout command needs to be enabled in your chatbot settings  
If the command is enabled, then the command can be executed by following the template below:
```
!so <overrides> <identifier>
```
`<overrides>` refers to an optional parameter, [see this for more detailed documentation.](./overrides.md)  
`<identifier>` is the name of the user (or an id/url if a direct `-d` [override](./overrides.md) is used)  
A name identifier is case-insensitive and allows a leading '@' symbol.

examples of commands:
```
!so @LitokaBot
!so litokabot
!so -n litokabot
!so -d https://twitch.tv/litokabot/clip/AwkwardHelplessSalamanderSwiftRage
```
Depending on your configuration, LitokaBot will be able to respond with a shoutout in chat.  

## Troubleshooting
Here are some considerations to help fix issues if the shoutout player isn't working correctly.
- Refreshing your browser source on OBS
- Generating a new link
- Check and update settings for `!so` on the 'Chat Bot' page
- Logout and Login again (to the litoka website)
